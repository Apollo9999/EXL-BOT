# Smartie
## A Complete solution of Intelligent Bot


#Project Objective 


Probelm Statement Identified as To Design and Develop a BOT that takes minimum information and instructions to recommend products to a user. The BOT can be configured by carrying out simple tasks such as uploading a set of questions and answers at a specific URL, which could be an API from the BOT admin. The BOT analyzes the data, makes third-party API calls, and makes product recommendations to the user. Further, the BOT analyses user response and starts recommending other products, like upselling and cross-selling.

The BOT eventually becomes the foundation for a better user experience driven by AI and Machine Learning.

Source Code of the  BOT  provides valuable information to a user through Q&A, supported by Natural Language Processing (NLP) making it a great training tool to onboard new users or new agents? Built with a two-way integration with the application, the BOT needs to be trained to be specific to their customers and their insurance policy products.

## Admin
Admin has the previlage to configure and build a new bot. 
We provide configuration layer i.e UI for admin, where a selection can be made with other 
configurable options.
Once the configuration is done. Train Process is initiated

We made train process automatic. 

Once the train is completed a bot will be built. 

Admin can even select from list of service providers
    AWS lex bot builder
    Google Dialogflow bot builder
    Rasa bot builder
    Kore AI bot builder
    Own customer NLP engine

## User
User can interact with any of the built bots.

## Recommendation engine
A recommendation engine is built and continously update for recommending best products for the user

## RL 
A reinforcement learning based algorithm is built that constantly updates the model with progress of
user interaction.
